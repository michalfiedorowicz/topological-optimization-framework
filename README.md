# Topological Optimization Framework
*This repository is currently private. All content will be uploaded here and made public soon.*

## Overview
The Topological Optimization Framework is a next-generation, industrial-scale solution for hyper-optimizing material usage—primarily wood and composite materials—in furniture manufacturing. By combining advanced analytical modeling, high-performance computing, machine learning, and Industry 4.0 integration, we ensure end-to-end minimization of waste and maximal structural performance.

## Key Features
- **Digital Twin-Enabled Workflow**: Real-time synchronization with CAD/CAM/PLM systems for continuous feedback between design, simulation, and production.
- **Multi-Material Support**: Extendable to wood, composites, metals, and hybrid structures.
- **AI-Driven Surrogate Models**: Use neural networks and Gaussian processes to approximate FE simulations, speeding up optimization loops by 10–100×.
- **Reinforcement Learning Optimizer**: Adaptive agent selects design variants and refines material distribution based on reward functions tied to weight, stiffness, and cost.
- **Scalable HPC & Cloud Native**: Kubernetes-based orchestration of CUDA-accelerated containers, supporting on-premises clusters and AWS/GCP/Azure deployments.
- **Automated CI/CD Pipeline**: Continuous integration of new material databases, model updates, and validation tests ensures reliability and fast iteration.
- **Digital Quality Assurance**: Integrated post-manufacturing scan comparison and compliance reporting against simulation predictions.
- **User-Friendly API & UI**: RESTful services and a React/Tailwind web dashboard for scheduling jobs, visualizing optimizations, and exporting G-code or native CAD formats.

## Roadmap
### Phase 1: Core Modeling & Numerical Engine (Q4 2026)
- Develop anisotropic elasticity models for wood and composites.
- Implement finite element analysis (FEA) core in C++ with Python bindings.
- Validate against analytical benchmarks and COMSOL Multiphysics.

### Phase 2: AI-Accelerated Optimization (Q1 2027)
- Train deep surrogate models on parameter sweeps (COMSOL & FEA data).
- Integrate reinforcement learning (RL) loop using OpenAI Gym-style environment.
- Benchmark RL agent vs. traditional density-based methods (SIMP, level-set).

### Phase 3: Cloud-Native Deployment & CI/CD (Q2 2027)
- Containerize modules with Docker and helm charts.
- Deploy Kubernetes cluster templates for GPU autoscaling.
- Set up GitHub Actions for testing, linting, and performance regression.

### Phase 4: Digital Twin & Manufacturing Integration (Q3 2027)
- Build CAD/CAM plugins (Fusion 360, SolidWorks) with WebSocket sync.
- Implement post-process API for scanning 3D-printed/sample parts via Artec/Einscan.
- Generate compliance reports (ISO standards, cost metrics).

### Phase 5: Production Rollout & Industry Partnerships (Q4 2027)
- Pilot with furniture manufacturers and material suppliers.
- Collect real-world data for continuous model refinement.
- Open ecosystem for third-party material models and optimization strategies.
